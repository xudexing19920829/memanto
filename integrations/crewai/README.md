# CrewAI + Memanto: Persistent Multi-Agent Memory

This package provides [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) tools for integrating [Memanto's](https://memanto.ai) persistent, cross-agent memory capabilities into your CrewAI pipelines. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install crewai-memanto
```

---

A real-world example of CrewAI agents using **Memanto** as their shared, persistent memory layer. Two agents collaborate through a semantic memory database that survives across sessions, agents, and runs.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Cross-agent memory sharing**: A Research Agent stores findings that a Writer Agent retrieves
- **Cross-session persistence**: Run the researcher today, run the writer tomorrow -- memories persist
- **Typed semantic memory**: 13 memory types (fact, observation, decision, etc.) with confidence scoring
- **Contradictory memory handling**: Detect and resolve conflicting facts (bonus)

## Architecture

![CrewAI + Memanto: Persistent Multi-Agent Memory](https://github.com/moorcheh-ai/memanto/raw/main/assets/crewai-architecture.png)

Both CrewAI agents share the **same Memanto agent ID** (`crewai-research-team`), giving them access to a shared memory namespace.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A [Moorcheh API key](https://console.moorcheh.ai/api-keys) (free tier: 100K ops/month)
- An [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (for CrewAI's LLM — free tier available)

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/moorcheh-ai/memanto.git
cd memanto/examples/crewai-memory

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your MOORCHEH_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

## Quick Start

Run the full pipeline (Research Agent + Writer Agent) in one command:

```bash
python run_full_pipeline.py
```

## Step-by-Step Demo (Proves Persistence)

This is the recommended flow for your terminal recording:

```bash
# Step 1: Research Agent stores findings in Memanto
python run_research.py

# Step 2: Writer Agent retrieves those memories in a NEW session
# (This proves memories persist across sessions!)
python run_writer.py

# Step 3 (Bonus): Demonstrate contradictory memory handling
python run_contradiction.py
```

## Architecture: Why Tool-Based Integration?

CrewAI offers two ways to plug in external memory:

1. **Native `StorageBackend` override** — Implement CrewAI's `StorageBackend` protocol and pass it via `Memory(storage=my_backend)`. CrewAI's memory pipeline (LLM analysis, consolidation, composite scoring) runs on top of your backend.

2. **Tool-based integration** — Provide Memanto operations as CrewAI tools that agents call directly.

**This example uses the tool-based approach.** Here's why:

- **API mismatch**: CrewAI's `StorageBackend.search()` receives a pre-computed **vector embedding**. By the time it reaches the storage layer, the original query text is lost. Memanto's API performs semantic search from **natural language text**, not raw vectors. There's no clean way to bridge this gap without redundant embedding work or losing Memanto's search quality.

- **Rich metadata**: The tool-based approach lets the LLM choose the right memory type (out of 13 semantic types), set confidence scores, and add tags at write time. A native backend override only receives what CrewAI's encoding pipeline extracts, which doesn't map to Memanto's type system.

- **No dual memory risk**: We explicitly set `memory=False` on all Crews to prevent CrewAI from injecting its own LanceDB-backed memory tools alongside the Memanto tools. When `memory=True`, CrewAI auto-injects "Search memory" and "Save to memory" tools into every agent — running both systems would cause duplicate storage and retrieval confusion.

> **Note**: Native `StorageBackend` integrations (like [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/) or [Mengram](https://community.crewai.com/t/mengram-human-like-memory-backend-for-crewai-pr-4595/7363)) work well when the external system accepts vector embeddings directly. Memanto's information-theoretic search operates on text, making the tool-based pattern the better fit.

### Namespace Design

All CrewAI agents in this example share a **single Memanto agent ID** (`crewai-research-team`), which maps to one Memanto namespace. This is intentional: the Research Agent stores findings and the Writer Agent retrieves them from the same namespace. Memanto's scope system (`memanto_agent_{agent_id}`) provides the isolation boundary — different crews or projects should use different agent IDs.

## How to Swap CrewAI Memory for Memanto

### Before: CrewAI's Built-in Memory

```python
from crewai import Crew

# CrewAI's built-in memory uses LanceDB locally
# When memory=True, CrewAI auto-injects "Search memory" and
# "Save to memory" tools into every agent
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    memory=True,  # Uses LanceDB, lost when storage is cleared
)
```

### After: Memanto Memory (Persistent)

```python
from memanto.cli.client.sdk_client import SdkClient
from crewai_memanto import MemantoSetup, create_memanto_tools

# 1. Set up Memanto (one-time per session)
setup = MemantoSetup(api_key="your-moorcheh-key")
client = setup.setup(agent_id="my-crew")

# 2. Create memory tools bound to your agent
tools = create_memanto_tools(client, agent_id="my-crew")

# 3. Give agents Memanto tools instead of using memory=True
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research and store findings",
    backstory="...",
    tools=[tools["remember"], tools["recall"]],  # Persistent memory!
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Retrieve findings and write",
    backstory="...",
    tools=[tools["recall"], tools["answer"]],  # Reads persistent memory!
)

# 4. Run the crew with memory=False to prevent dual memory systems
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[...],
    memory=False,  # Memanto handles memory via tools
)
crew.kickoff()
```

**Key differences:**
| Feature | CrewAI Memory | Memanto Memory |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Persistence | Session only | Permanent |
| Cross-agent | Same crew only | Any agent, any session |
| Search | Embedding-based | Semantic (Moorcheh) |
| Memory types | Untyped | 13 semantic types |
| Confidence scoring | No | Yes (0.0-1.0) |
| Conflict detection | No | Yes |
| Cost at idle | N/A | Zero (serverless) |

## Bonus: Cursor Integration

After running the CrewAI pipeline, you can access the same memories from Cursor:

```bash
# Connect Cursor to Memanto globally (all projects)
memanto connect cursor --global

# Or for a specific project directory
memanto connect cursor --project-dir /path/to/your/project
```

This creates `.cursor/rules/memanto.mdc` (memory instructions) and `.cursor/skills/memanto/SKILL.md` (memory type guide). Open any project in Cursor and ask it to recall your research findings -- it accesses the same Memanto memory namespace used by the CrewAI agents.

**Example Cursor prompt after running the CrewAI pipeline:**
> "Use memanto recall to find what the research team stored about AI agent market size"

## Troubleshooting

- **"MOORCHEH_API_KEY not set"**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key
- **"No active session"**: The setup manager handles this automatically; check your API key is valid
- **"Agent already exists"**: This is normal -- the setup reuses existing agents
- **CrewAI LLM errors**: Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set, or override with `CREWAI_LLM` env var
